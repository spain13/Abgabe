          <h2>OUR STORY</h2>
          <p>
            I started my first coffee shop in 2004 in Hampstead Garden Suburbs
            after deciding to give up my 9 to 5 job in the city. With no
            catering experience, the only way I knew how to operate a business
            was NOT to look at it as a business. I treated it like my home and
            all the customers were guests in my home.<br /><br />
            After 13 years, I still stand by the same principle as I have not
            yet learnt the art of the business but have mastered the art of
            being a host. We buy the best fresh ingredients and cook the food I
            serve to my family at home. Everything is freshly cooked on site and
            served immediately to our guests.
